The Haskell XML Toolbox is a collection of tools for processing XML with
Haskell.

The Haskell XML Toolbox is available from:
    http://www.fh-wedel.de/~si/HXmlToolbox/

Detailed information about the features, changes, requirements, installation and documentation
is available from that web page.

This is the "old" approach with the filters like in HaXmL.
The package name for these modules is "mxt-filter".
It requires the "mxt" package to be installed.
For new projects we strongly recomend the
library based on arrows (package "mxt").

Good luck,
